and the mobile app is at /mobile-app directory
dont create too many terminal windows ,stick with one terminal window for all the commands and instructions untill i terminate it manually.
if you are installing dependencies or packages , wait untill the installation is complete before giving the next instruction or command and check if there is any error in installation logs.
you are not allowed to change logic 
.
you are not allowed to change code inside vercel-serverless and desktop-app folders.

no seperate sever for mobile app , use the existing vercel serverless backend for mobile app as well. just make sure to update the api urls in mobile app to point to the vercel serverless backend instead of localhost.
